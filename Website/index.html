            <ul>
                <li>The game is organized in turns.</li>
                <li>Once it is the player's turn, the player gets an image/video/audio and has to memorize all of its contents in 10 seconds.</li>
                <li>When 10 seconds pass, the player gets a random question based on what they got. If the answer is correct, the player gets 100 points.</li>
                <li>While the player is trying to answer the question, the other players have 5 seconds to guess if the player would answer the question correctly or not. The reward for a correct guess is 40 points.</li>
                <li>The game lasts for 5 rounds, so every player will have to answer 5 questions in total.</li>
